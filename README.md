# pipeline-RISC-V-CPU

## HFUT/合肥工业大学硬件课程综合设计

I implemented a pipeline RISC-V CPU, and it surports more than 25 instrucstions. I had tested them in a EGO1 development board
you can test them by downloading the **./runs/impl_1/CPU.bit file and installing your board
although it can runs in the board, but it's not a relative good project.
